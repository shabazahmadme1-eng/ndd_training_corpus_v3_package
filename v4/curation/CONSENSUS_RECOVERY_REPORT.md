# Recovering provenance for the collapsed-consensus targets

**Scientific qualification, 26 September 2026:** Rank identity strongly supports shared
measurement lineage; it does not prove a unique historical source or normalization pipeline.
Imperfect agreement alone does not establish aggregation. Read historical claims below
with this qualification. Robust primary analyses exclude consensus and import reviewed
deposited measurements directly.

**Date:** 2026-09-21
**Scope:** the 25 `gate_consensus` assays, 136,734 measurements, previously carrying no
experimental context and `score_direction = as_supplied_unknown_biological_direction`.

## The idea

The V3 corpus supplied these targets rescaled to 0–1 with their provenance stripped. A
**rank-preserving rescale destroys values but not order.** So a candidate source can be tested
directly: if a deposited score set covers the same variants and its scores are a monotone
function of the supplied targets, it *is* the source.

The test is Spearman ρ on overlapping variants, searched over reference-numbering offsets.
ρ = ±1.0 at high coverage is proof of a rank-preserving relabel. Implemented in
`scripts/recover_consensus_provenance.py`; read-only with respect to the corpus.

## Result

**13 of 25 consensus assays identified — 53,207 of 136,734 rows (38.9%).**

| Gene | Rows | ρ | Coverage | Recovered assay |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| CRX | 5,284 | **+1.0000** | 100% | HEK293-derived cells, synthetic fluorescent reporter |
| ASPA | 5,843 | **+1.0000** | 100% | VAMP-seq abundance, HEK293T landing pad |
| MAPK1 | 6,810 | **−1.0000** | 100% | A375, doxycycline-induced proliferation screen |
| SPOP | 6,261 | **−1.0000** | 100% | yeast survival assay |
| LARGE1 | 4,484 | +1.0000 | 100% | SMuRF, α-dystroglycan glycosylation |
| FKRP | 2,878 | +1.0000 | 100% | SMuRF, α-dystroglycan glycosylation |
| OTC | 1,570 | +1.0000 | 100% | yeast *arg3Δ* solid-growth complementation |
| SUMO1 | 1,919 | +0.9999 | 100% | yeast complementation, DMS-TileSeq |
| BRCA2 | 462 | +1.0000 | 100% | HDR assay in **V-C8 (Chinese hamster)** cells |
| KCNQ1 | 62 | +1.0000 | 100% | normalised currents, electrophysiology |
| PALB2 | 6,718 | +0.9965 | 100% | **mouse embryonic stem cells**, PARPi sensitivity |
| PSAT1 | 1,915 | +0.9935 | 99.9% | yeast solid-growth complementation |
| TSC2 | 9,001 | +0.9920 | 98.8% | Tuberin + RapGAP domain combined scores |

Ten match at |ρ| = 1.0 with complete coverage — these are single assays relabelled, not
aggregates. Three match at ρ ≈ 0.99 (`strong_partial`): near-certain but not exact, consistent
with light aggregation or filtering differences. They are recorded at
`condition_mapping_unresolved` status rather than `verified`.

**Still unresolved (12 genes, 83,527 rows):** ADSL, AIRE, BRCA1, CBS, HMGCR, JAG1, KCNE1,
KCNQ2, KRAS, MTHFR, PAX6, PTEN. AIRE and JAG1 have no matching target gene in MaveDB at all.
The other ten have best-candidate ρ between 0.78 and 0.97 at high coverage — **which is itself
evidence that those really are aggregates**, as the name implied. CBS (ρ=0.957 against a
single B6 arm) and MTHFR (ρ=0.888 against one folate/background arm) are the clearest cases:
the study deposited several arms and the consensus appears to average them.

## Two findings that matter for training

### 1. Two genes are rank-inverted relative to their source

`MAPK1` and `SPOP` match at **ρ = −1.0**. The supplied target is ordered *opposite* to the
deposited scores.

The corpus is internally consistent — consensus and the ProteinGym copy of MAPK1 agree at
ρ = +1.0, because ProteinGym also records `raw_DMS_directionality = -1`. So this is **not a
live training bug.** It is a trap for anyone who later joins raw MaveDB scores onto these rows,
which would silently mix orientations. Recorded as
`recovered_orientation = inverted_relative_to_source`; a test asserts a negative ρ is always
declared. No measurement was changed.

### 2. Three consensus assays duplicate data already in the corpus

`OTC`, `PSAT1` and `MAPK1` consensus rows are the same measurements already present as
`OTC_HUMAN_Lo_2023`, `SERC_HUMAN_Xie_2023` and `MK01_HUMAN_Brenan_2016` — confirmed at
ρ = +1.0, +0.9935 and +1.0 against their in-corpus counterparts.

The build script already caught this: all three are flagged
`possible_consensus_constituent_overlap = 1` and down-weighted to 0.25. The recovery confirms
the flag was correct and upgrades it from suspicion to certainty.

**These pairs are scientifically useful, not just redundant.** The same measurement appears
twice under two different monotone transforms — raw scale and 0–1 squash — with identical
ranks. That is a ready-made test of whether a metadata-conditioned observation model handles
assay scale, using data you already have.

## What changed in the metadata

| Field | Before | After first curation | After recovery |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| host | 111 unknown | 25 | **16** |
| selection | 26 | 25 | **13** |
| system | 84 | 25 | **13** |
| treatment | 120 | 33 | **27** |
| region | 25 | 25 | **13** |

Unresolved model fields: the supplied research queue listed **366**; **82** remain.

Host composition also shifted: human cell lines rose from 18.8% to **20.6%** of rows, and two
hosts appeared that were previously invisible — **mouse ES cells** (PALB2) and **Chinese
hamster V-C8** (BRCA2). Both are cases where a human protein is assayed in a non-human host,
exactly the distinction the curation guards against.

## Correction to the earlier report

`METADATA_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` stated that consensus provenance "cannot be recovered by
research". **That was too strong.** What was established is that the *supplied files* contain
no provenance. It was not tested whether the constituent assays were independently
identifiable. For 13 of 25 they are. The report has been corrected.

## Reproduce

```bash
python scripts/recover_consensus_provenance.py   # rank-match against MaveDB (network, ~10 min)
python scripts/build_assay_overrides.py          # fold results into the override document
python scripts/curate_v4_metadata.py             # replay onto the metadata table
python -m pytest -q                              # 31 passed
```

Verified: reset to the pristine baseline `bb98120b…`, rebuilt end-to-end, **byte-identical
output**. No measurement, score, coordinate, orientation or raw directionality was modified;
recovery is recorded in added columns only.

## What would close the remaining 83,527 rows

- **CBS, MTHFR, ADSL, PAX6, KCNE1, KCNQ2** — the deposits contain multiple arms. Test whether
  a *mean of ranks* across arms reproduces the consensus, rather than any single arm.
- **BRCA1, KRAS, PTEN** — best candidates cover only 32–68% of variants; likely aggregates of
  several score sets. Test combinations.
- **AIRE, JAG1** — absent from MaveDB. Would need the original publications or author deposits.
